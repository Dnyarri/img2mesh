# Bitmap to POVRay 3D triangle mesh converter

Img2mesh is a Python program for conversion of bitmap heightfield (in PNG and PGM/PPM formats) to 3D triangle mesh in [POV-Ray](https://www.povray.org/) POV, Wavefront OBJ, Autodesk DXF and stereolithography (3D printer) STL format. Resulting triangle mesh provides better rendering in case of low-res source files as compared to using source bitmaps as a heightfield directly.  

## Keep quite in the Mausoleum

Current branch is a mausoleum of Geometry №1, initial version, using most obvious triangle mesh geometry. Geometry №1 was started somewhen at the end of 2023; during following two years it was replaced with Geometry №2 and Geometry №3, and in end of 2025 with Geometry №3+ which actually includes Geometry №1 as a particular case.

Therefore Geometry №1 became obsolete, but, in recognition of its services, deserved honourable mummification as a separate branch of [img2mesh repository](https://github.com/Dnyarri/img2mesh).

Current code absorbed all the optimizations intended for more recent version to date, and, in general, is quite nice, but it's suspended, frozen, mothballed and encased in carbonite, and so be it.
