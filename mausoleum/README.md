# img2mesh - Bitmap to POV-Ray 3D triangle mesh converter

## Version 1

Current folder contain img2mesh for Geometry №1 variant, i.e. the first 3D mesh geometry version developed back in 2023.

Surely corresponding module was significantly improved (and became a module rather than standalone program) and grown up quite mature since 2023, but it still uses most simple 3D mesh geometry.

After introduction of Geometry №2 and later Geometry №3 this algorithm has become obsolete, but I decided to keep it here in mausoleum in perfect hibernation.
